###记录一下上传AppStore出现的一些问题
>1.公司名混淆

```java
Guideline 5.2.1 - Legal - Intellectual Property


The seller and company names associated with your app do not reflect financial institution, as required by Guideline 5.2.1 of the App Store Review Guidelines.

Next Steps

Your app must be published under a seller name and company name that reflects financial institution. If you have developed this app on behalf of a client, please advise your client to add you to the development team of their Apple Developer account.

Once created, you cannot change your seller name or company name in iTunes Connect. For assistance with changing your company name or seller name, you will need to contact iTunes Connect through the Contact Us page. Select Getting Started from the first dropdown menu, then select General iTunes Connect Inquiry to contact the appropriate iTunes Connect team.
